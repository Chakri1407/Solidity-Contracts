Voting Contract README
Introduction
This Solidity contract, named Voting, facilitates voting on proposals within a group of members. It allows members to create proposals and cast votes either in favor or against them. Once a proposal reaches a predefined threshold of votes, it can be executed.

Contract Overview
The contract comprises the following main components:

Enums:

VoteStates: Represents the states of votes, including Absent, Yes, and No.
Constants:

VOTE_THRESHOLD: Defines the threshold required for a proposal to be executed.
Structs:

Proposal: Represents a proposal with attributes such as target address, proposal data, execution status, and vote counts.
Events:

ProposalCreated(uint): Triggered when a new proposal is created, emitting the proposal's index.
VoteCast(uint, address indexed): Triggered when a vote is cast, emitting the proposal index and the voter's address.
Mappings:

members: Maps addresses to boolean values indicating membership status.
Constructor:

Initializes the contract with an array of member addresses.
Functions:

newProposal: Allows members to create new proposals.
castVote: Enables members to cast votes on proposals.
Usage
Deployment:

Deploy the contract by providing an array of member addresses in the constructor.
Proposal Creation:

Members can create new proposals by calling the newProposal function, providing the target address and data for the proposal.
Voting:

Members cast their votes using the castVote function, specifying the proposal ID and their vote (Yes or No).
Execution:

Once a proposal reaches the predefined vote threshold, it can be executed, triggering the execution of the associated target function.
Considerations
Ensure that the threshold (VOTE_THRESHOLD) is appropriately set based on the number of members and desired consensus level.
Verify the permissions and access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized actions.
Review and test the contract thoroughly to identify any vulnerabilities or potential exploits.
